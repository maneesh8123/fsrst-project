        data: data set from kaggle and this is  a kaggle problem
       
   here ,i used one of the ensembel technique called BAGGING ,in bagging Random forest alogrithm is used to solve this problem
  
  
  one of the main advantage of Random Forest is ,from this problem i did get an  accurate data with low variance and low bias
